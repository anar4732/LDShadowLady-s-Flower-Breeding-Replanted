This mod allows you to cross-pollinate vanilla flowers to create different flowers in a variety of colours.

Craft an empty pollen jar to begin, use it to right-click a vanilla flower to collect pollen.
Transfer the pollen onto another vanilla flower to receive seeds.
The seeds can be planted and farmed like vanilla crops.
Once they are fully-grown you can harvest the flowers to place elsewhere.
